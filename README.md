# L-Airline API Rest Project

### In this project I will use FlyWay (to manage DataBase versions), Spring Framework (JPA for persistence; Web (to manage Http Methods); Security (to manage and custom authenticaton and authorization); Email(to send messages or warning to users)); Jedis (to manage cache data).

Will be my first time using Jedis.
